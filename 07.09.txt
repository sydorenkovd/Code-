user_id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, - increment id +1, and id become like a key table, "not null" say that every cell(ячейка) must have any meaning.
From $_REQUEST we get some data(данные) from web-form, and then we put this to $variables like:
$first_name = trim($_REQUEST['first_name]); - and than we can create sql-request with this variables ant put it to $insert_sql = "INSERT INTO users (first_name, and other data-cell) " . 
                            "VALUES('{$first_name}', and other '{$varibles}');"
// Insert the user into the database
mysql_query($insert_sql); we can add "or die(mysql_error());" if we can't get any meaning from $insert_sql.
// Redirect the user to the page that displays user information
header("Location: show_user.php?user_id=" . $user_id);
  mysql_insert_id() - function in php language that return last meaning INSERT from MYsql.
