In php there are function like "trim()" that can delete all spaces(пробелы) and it's so comfort for user, that one pass(пропустит) some spaces, or took some more.
$first_name = trim($_REQUEST['first_name']);
-----------
$_REQUEST - it's special veriable in php, that has all information with a web-form.
-----------
and now it's time talk about mysql: we have studied operators like: USE, DESCRIBE, SHOW, SELECT * FROM, CREATE TABLE OR DROP TABLE (something other);

Chapter 4: Include mysql from php
mysql_connect(); - it's function for connect to database, it get 3 parameters(database_host, database_username, database_password). If some of this parametres can't work, we can use function "die" and show user error message.
other usefull function is "mysql_select_db(DATABASE_NAME); - it's аналог функции USE, and just choose this database.
One new useful function is $result = "mysql_query("SHOW TABLES;"); - that you can add to veriable and use, this function receive some SQL-code and just do this.

--------PDO(PHP Data Object---------
// connect to Database
$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=ijdb', 'user(root)',
'password') ;
//send database request
$pdo->exec($sql);
//return PDOStatement as a result-resource.
$sql = 'SELECT joketext FROM joke';
$result = $pdo->query($sql);
//обрабатываем запрос, приходит массив.
while ($row = $result->fetch())
{
  $jokes[] = $row['joketext'];
}

foreach ($result as $row)
{
$jokes[] = $row['joketext1];
